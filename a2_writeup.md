# Assignment 2 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.  We also will discuss how we match things in chatbots in order to extract what a user is trying to find.  Next assignment we will work with data bases and how we can extract information from them.

## What to complete
1. Go through the notes.py file w/ Mr. Berg
2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?

I would say that the thing that was difficult while completing the match function was following all the steps and rules to get it to work. Some of this stuff is definitely new to me, and so when Mr. Berg was explaining how to complete it, I was trying to do it without no mistakes, which was pretty hard to do. 



2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.

To use the match function to extract information from a movie database, you'd have to find a specific way/format to make it easy to find films/movies. For instance, we got a list with movies that start with the word "Christmas", for this, one can use the match fuction "Christmas", "_", something around that, and it would find the movies that start with that word.
